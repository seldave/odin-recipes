    <p><h2>All You Need To Know About This Recipe</h2></p>
    <p>I created this beef stroganoff recipe with hamburger because I love the taste of a good stroganoff, but I don't like the expense of beef tips, steak, or roast beef, nor do I 
        like all the time it takes to make them. My version is creamy and tastes great.</p>
